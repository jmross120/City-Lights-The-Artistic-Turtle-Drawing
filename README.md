# City-Lights-The-Artistic-Turtle-Drawing
An artistic turtle drawing of a city that creates a random drawing every time its generated.

As stated in the brief dexcription, this code creates a random night time cityscape with every new generation. 

each function is clearly labled as to its purpose and what it generates. 

the city_skyline function accesses the tower() and lights() functions to generate around 50 towers. the code is organized so there will be taller towers in the center back with shorter towers more evenly spread out along the foreground. This is the unique part about this art piece. Everytime you generate the code it will make something new, so the image i have provided is only my generation, but it might not be yours. 

The gradient background took a long time to figure out. I wrote some code that generated a gradient line by line but it slowed down the entire project considerably. I generated the current gradient code from CHATGPT. it does essentially the same thing its just better optimized for turtle. I included my original code to show what i did initially. the updated code from CHATGPT is more for testing convienince than anything.
